# Overview

This project employs exploratory data analysis to extract valuable information for Microsoft, aiming to establish a new movie studio. By analyzing datasets from IMDB and Box Office Mojo, the project provides recommendations regarding the film genres that Microsoft should consider exploring.

The success and popularity of each genre are evaluated using two key metrics: the total gross incomes and the critical response. The results suggest that Microsoft would benefit from concentrating on genres such as Sci-Fi, adventure, animation, and action, as these genres have demonstrated higher total gross income.

# Business Problem

Microsoft is poised to step into the realm of original video content creation, gearing up to establish its own movie studio. However, the challenge lies in navigating an unfamiliar landscape, as the company lacks substantial experience in this domain. To address this, a comprehensive analysis of prevailing trends in successful films at the box office becomes imperative. This analysis aims to uncover valuable insights through exploratory data analysis, offering guidance to the leadership of Microsoft's nascent movie studio in making informed decisions regarding film genres and themes.

**Key Inquiries:**
    
1. Which movie genres exhibit the most robust financial performance in terms of box office gross?

2. How do different movie genres fare in terms of average audience ratings?

3. Is there any discernible correlation between a movie's average rating and its box office gross?

4. How does the distribution of domestic and foreign box office gross vary over the years, categorized by movie release dates?

By delving into these questions, Microsoft's movie studio head can gain actionable intelligence to shape the studio's content strategy and maximize its chances of success in the competitive entertainment industry landscape.
